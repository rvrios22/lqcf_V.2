        study: "Sunday Service",
        desc: "In our Sunday morning service, Pastor Mark has been preaching through the book of Genesis, focusing on chapters 37-50. James Vernon McGee describes this section as focusing on Joseph, who is portrayed as a figure of honor and virtue. McGee notes that Josephâ€™s life parallels that of Christ in many ways, though he is not explicitly called a type of Christ in the New Testament. This study will explore the life and character of Joseph and the lessons he exemplifies for believers. Join us as we glorify the Lord together."

        study: "Wednesday Service",
        desc: "The Book of Romans, written by the Apostle Paul, is the focus of our Wednesday service. Known as 'The chief part of the New Testament and the very purest gospel,' this book has profoundly impacted many, including the church father Augustine. The study aims to deepen our faith and understanding of Jesus Christ, who was delivered over to death for our sins and raised to life for our justification. Come grow in your knowledge and relationship with the Lord."
